"An energized and personable student at Terna Engineering College pursuing Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering (GPA 8.496). Eager to adapt my skills and knowledge to the best of my ability in Mechanical engineering applications to assist and grow fundamental knowledge with my experience. Research and analysis are critical components that can be used to solve complex problems. I have participated in Industrial Robotics training offered by CEMS. In our training, we used industrial robotic arms to implement the Material handling, Plasma cutting, and Welding processes. The training consisted of 30% in a software environment and 70% in the field. We spent 65% of our time coding a robotic arm in Kuka Robot Language (KRL). Our training was heavily focused on industrial automation. Using software and code, I developed a vertical 3 x 3 matrix-shaped pick and place operation. Plasma cutting procedures were being carried out on various metals. MasterCam software is used to program the machine for precision cutting. For improved performance and flexibility, an 8-axis robotic cell was particularly constructed for welding operations. We finished our training by developing a CEMS logo in software and cutting this out of a stainless steel sheet."
